# Summary

The Spanish UD is converted from the content head version of the [universal
dependency treebank v2.0 (legacy)](https://github.com/ryanmcd/uni-dep-tb).


# Introduction

In addition to converting dependencies from the legacy UD treebank, token level morphology features have been added
automatically using the parsers/taggers in Bohnet et al (2014) and Bohnet et al. (2015) trained on the Ancora
treebank and converted automatically to UD standards.

Various heuristics have been added to improve the output of the tagger, fix obvious errors and add features that
the tagger did not supply. The changes for v1.2 (November 2015) were done by Miguel Ballesteros, Dan Zeman, and
Héctor Martínez Alonso.

The Spanish UD conforms to the UD guidelines, but there are some exceptions.

# Changelog

* 2023-05-15 v2.12

  * Existential "hay" and necessitative "hay que": AUX changed to VERB.
  * "cuyo" is a relative determiner.
  * "qué", "cuál" are interrogative, not relative.
